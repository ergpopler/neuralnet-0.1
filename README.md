# neuralnet-0.1

ok, you put a movie review or write one, and it will give you a thingie between 0 and 1, the closer to 1 the more positive the review is.
0.9 for example would be a 5 star review, and a 0.1 would be a 1 star, or whatever.

anyways, don't bully me. YES i know it would take someone 5 minutes to make this, YES i know this is pretty much useless.
